                A medical practitioner in Kadapa has carved a name for herself by offering medical check-ups to the poor for a consultation fee of ₹10. <br> Dr. Noori Parveen has become a household name for thousands of families by making medical care accessible to people who aren’t able to afford the expensive consultation fees at corporate hospitals. <br>

                It all started with children hailing from lower income and socio-economic groups bringing their sick siblings to her clinic in Kadapa city. <br> “They can hardly afford ₹250 or ₹350 as consultation fee, and I thought I should reach out. It was then that I decided to charge a flat consultation fee of ₹10 from every patient,”  <br>Dr. Parveen told The Hindu .
